# CS-465-Full-Stack-Development

## Architecture
- Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).<br><br>
Express HTML was a simple web set up where the backend of the site ran express which would route the pages where they were needed, delivering simple HTML web pages. Javascript was used with Angular for our single page application (SPA). The SPA instead of delivering new HTML pages just transferred the information or data needed for the website whenever the state changed.
- Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?<br><br>
NoSQL is a type of database that is structureless. Instead it just sends documents which can be any structure using something like JSON. MongoDB is a popular utilizes NoSQL so there is plenty of documentation to reference when building our web application.
## Functionality
- How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?<br><br>
JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is a formatting style used to format data. Javascript is a programming language that is used frequently for web development. JSON ties together frontend and backend development because it is a common way to transfer information that is being sent from the backend to the frontend. Javascript can easily access this info to display information in things like an SPA.<br><br>
- Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.<br><br>
An instance where we refactored our simple HTML project was when we utilized the Model-View-Controller methodology. This is where we created a controller that handled the route of the webpage, like the home page. A view that took care of the look of the web pages and finally a model that handles data that is stored within the webpage.<br><br>
## Testing
- Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.<br><br>
The addition of methods is beneficial in the production of a web page that handles multiple operations. These blocks of code were used to build out the endpoints that handled things like GET and POST calls. Testing was done using Postman to make api call to the endpoints to ensure we are getting the proper responses. Finally, security is very important when building an web application so we can create a secure and safe log in page. It goes a step further when we add an admin user who is able to edit the information on the page. This level of access needs to be limited to only the authorized users.<br><br>
## Reflection
- How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?<br><br>
This course has helped me to understand how the front-end and the back-end of a web application communicate with one another. In addition, I have learned about the different ways an full stack application can be structured based on the needs of the application. As I continue in my learning I find it beneficial to be exposed to more types of technologies that broaden my understanding and capabilities as a software engineer.<br>
